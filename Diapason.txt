Diapason

—Madeleine L’Engle

legs strung loose
to the ground	
carrying me blindly	 	
mammal dark

feathered grace 
molecules spindling sweetly 
shapes distant 
from my own
singing furred
and colorless

I am in space
I feel loyalty 
in soil
participle 	string

in the backyard 
beneath the big rock 
a snake
baking bellydown 
as we leave
for a sunless planet

open your mouth
it says crooning
drink the saltwater
we have in abundance here
